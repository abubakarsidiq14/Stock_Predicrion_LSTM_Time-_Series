# Stock_Predicrion_LSTM_Time-_Series
we'll learn how to predict tomorrow's S&P 500 index price using historical data. We'll also learn how to avoid common issues that make most stock price models overfit in the real world.  We'll start by downloading S&P 500 prices using a package called yfinance.  Then, we'll clean up the data with pandas, and get it ready for machine learning.    We'll train a random forest model and make predictions using backtesting.  Then, we'll improve the model by adding predictors.  We'll end with next steps you can use to improve the model on your own.
